- **Power Query** – for data cleaning and transformation
## **Process**
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean concerning data type, data format, and values used.
- Used Power Query (Merge Queries) to combine five sales(2020-2024)datasets  into one dataset.
- Created two new tables (Date & Measure) to simplify the data analysis process  
- Applied bookmarks, including Slicers, to explore different moments.
